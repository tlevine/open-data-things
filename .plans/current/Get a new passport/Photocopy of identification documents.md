Bring a photocopy of the front and back of each ID document that you will present when you apply.

* Photocopy must be on plain white, 8 1/2 x 11" standard paper stock, showing the front and the back of your ID
* Photocopy must contain images on only one-side of each page submitted.
* If copies cannot be made on the same side of one page, you may present two separate pages; one displaying the front of the ID and the second displaying the back of the ID.
* The paper should be free of other images and/or markings.
* The 8 1/2 x 11" paper size cannot be substituted with a larger or smaller size paper, even if the alternative folds down to the 8 1/2 x 11" size.
* You may enlarge the image of your ID on the 8 1/2 x 11" page, but you may not decrease the size of the image.
