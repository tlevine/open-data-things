Relate features from open data portals to the
open data policy best practice implementation
in the Sunlight document that Rebecca sent me.
(It's a Google Spreadsheet.)

This spreadsheet tells me whether each portal
meets the different guidelines, and Rebecca
keeps it up-to-date. I could look for correlations
between guideline-following and usage.
