* Amount 1 (present contribution) versus Amount 2 (total contributions within the election cycle)
* Reconcile shell companies
* Infer the distribution of contributions, including the cut-off below $100
* Relate contributions to income and political leaning
* Connect the contributions to lobbyists
* Find who from outside of Oakland is contributing
* Find other campaign finance datasets, and run the analyses across them, and do some more interesting comparison of them too
* Make a music video
* Find fundraisers
* Use financing as a proxy for political leaning, and see how different human groups
    (occupation, location, race) lean
